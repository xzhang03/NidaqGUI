Rotary encoder works with nanosec to determine the running position of the wheel. Two active-low beam breakers are used to encode direction. Four channels of an audio jack are used (3.3V - driving IR LED and logic level, Enc1 - active low beam breaker, Enc2 - active low beam breaker, Ground). The current limiting resistor can be anywhere between 150 and 350 Ohms. The original design credit goes to Arthur Sugden.
