% This example demonstrates how to acquire a finite amount of data with
% manual triggers.
%
% When TriggerType is Manual, acquisition begins when TRIGGER command is
% issued, not START. Since the task initialization is already finished by
% START, TRIGGER is executed in no time.
%
% ManualTriggerHwOn can take either 'Start' or 'Trigger'. When it is
% 'Start', the device begins sampling with START so you can check the
% values of samples with PEEKDATA before actually acquiring data.
%
% This example repeates acquisition once (TriggerRepeat is 1). When
% multiple triggers are included in a single getdata call, a NaN is
% included into the returned data and time arrays.
