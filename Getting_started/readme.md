# I just received an Nanosec box. What do I do?

## 0. What did I get?
Below are items that you could have received:

	1. A nanosec box (with teensy 4.0 in the center). Hardware details are [here](https://github.com/xzhang03/NidaqGUI/tree/master/PCBs/Nanosec)
	2. A nanosec tester. This is a gadget that is functionally equivalent to a nanosec box but doesn't have any BNC connectors or audio jacks. It is meant to test the config files and timings before deploying to your photometry rigs. It uses on-PCB LEDS to indicate when each digital pulse is sent out and uses buttons to mimic natural inputs (e.g., licking).
